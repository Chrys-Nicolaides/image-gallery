# My first React & Tailwindcss exercise! 🏃‍♀️

I've been very excited to learn Tailwindcss and practice React. Having learned the fundamentals of JS, I really appreciate how easier it is working in React.

I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiGmAI5e91M) tutorial by Brad Traversy.
It was really fun, I enjoy his work and teaching style!
